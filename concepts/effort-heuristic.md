# Effort Heuristic (Inverse)

## What It Is

The effort heuristic: we associate effort with value—things that took more effort seem more valuable. The inverse effect with AI: because AI work feels effortless, solo work feels unnecessarily hard by comparison.

## Why It Matters

AI creates a contrast effect. After experiencing AI's effortless output, the normal effort of thinking feels like a bug rather than a feature. This makes productive struggle feel wrong even when it's exactly what builds capacity.

## Key Insight

The inverse effort heuristic creates a self-reinforcing loop:

1. AI produces output effortlessly
2. Solo work feels harder by comparison
3. You associate that difficulty with inefficiency
4. You use AI more to avoid "unnecessary" effort
5. Solo work feels even harder (contrast increases)
6. Repeat

The effort you're avoiding is often the exact effort that builds expertise. The heuristic misleads you into thinking struggle is a problem to solve rather than a feature of learning.
