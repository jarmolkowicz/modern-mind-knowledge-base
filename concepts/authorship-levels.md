# Authorship Levels

## What It Is

A vocabulary for self-awareness about your contribution to work: Primary, Collaborative, Curatorial, or Nominal authorship.

## Why It Matters

Knowing your actual authorship level enables honesty with yourself and others. Claiming creation when you're curating creates psychological hollowness. Accurate self-assessment enables appropriate accountability.

## Key Insight

| Level | Description | Indicator |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Primary** | You originated the core thinking | Could recreate without AI (slower, less polished, but substantially same) |
| **Collaborative** | You and AI co-created substantially | Clear which parts are yours vs. AI's. Exceeds what either could produce alone. |
| **Curatorial** | AI generated, you selected/arranged with expert judgment | Your expertise determined what made the cut. |
| **Nominal** | Accepted AI output with minimal judgment | Can't clearly explain why this is good or what you contributed. |

**Why it matters:**
- **Self-awareness** - Know when you've slipped from driver to passenger seat
- **Honesty** - Claim authorship level that matches contribution
- **Psychological health** - Claiming creation when curating creates hollowness

**Status:** Useful vocabulary for self-assessment. Not operationally essential—you can practice Strategic Alternation without tracking authorship levels explicitly.
