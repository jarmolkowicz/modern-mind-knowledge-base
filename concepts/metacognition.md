# Metacognition

## What It Is

The awareness and understanding of your own thinking processes—knowing what you know, recognizing when you don't understand, and monitoring the quality of your own cognition.

## Why It Matters

Metacognition is the master skill for navigating AI. It enables calibration, recognizing biases, detecting erosion, and maintaining agency. Without metacognition, you can't monitor your own state.

## Key Insight

Metacognition is trainable and protective. You can get better at monitoring your own cognition, and this skill helps protect against erosion.

Key questions:
- "Do I actually understand this, or does it just feel familiar?"
- "Am I thinking, or am I accepting AI thinking?"
- "Could I do this without AI?"

**SCAN's three metacognitive components:**

1. **Real-time evaluation** - Moment-to-moment monitoring during task: Which zone am I in? Is AI output reliable? Am I thinking or accepting?

2. **Reflection** - After task completion: What did I learn vs. delegate? Was my zone assessment accurate? What would I do differently?

3. **Learning** - Incorporate insights: Update mental models of your capabilities and AI's. Adjust future task-zone assignments.

These form a self-sustaining cycle that strengthens over time.
