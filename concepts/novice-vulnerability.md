# Novice Vulnerability

## What It Is

Early-career professionals are most vulnerable to AI-induced capability erosion. Counterintuitively, juniors should use LESS AI than seniors—the opposite of common practice.

## Why It Matters

Challenges the assumption that AI democratizes expertise. While AI helps novices produce senior-level output today, it may prevent them from developing the capability to produce that output independently tomorrow.

## Key Insight

From research synthesis:
- Experienced developers showed no skill degradation over 6 months with AI tools
- Junior developers using AI showed slower progression to "proficient" level
- 68% of surveyed professionals report AI has reduced learning opportunities for junior staff

Expertise level is a key moderator of erosion risk.

## Career Stage Recommendations

**Early Career (0-5 years)**:
- Priority: CAPABILITY BUILDING
- AI Use: CONSERVATIVE (less than seniors)
- Most vulnerable, longest career horizon
- Time investment: 3-5 hours/week on capability maintenance

**Mid Career (5-15 years)**:
- Priority: BALANCE productivity + capability
- AI Use: MODERATE (strategic)
- Time investment: 2-3 hours/week

**Senior/Expert (15+ years)**:
- Priority: PRODUCTIVITY (can afford more AI)
- AI Use: LIBERAL (less erosion risk)
- Time investment: 1-2 hours/week

## The Paradox

Those who need AI most for immediate performance are those who can least afford its long-term costs. Those who could safely use AI extensively often don't need it as much.
