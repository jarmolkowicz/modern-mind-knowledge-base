# Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)

## What It Is

The space between what a learner can do independently and what they cannot do even with help. In the ZPD, a learner can accomplish tasks with appropriate guidance ("scaffolding") from someone more knowledgeable.

## Why It Matters

ZPD explains why AI can either build or erode capacity. When AI acts as scaffolding within your ZPD, it can accelerate learning. When it substitutes for work outside your ZPD, you never develop the capability.

## Key Insight

Three zones of knowledge:
- **Known to learner** - Can do independently
- **ZPD** - Can do with scaffolding (where learning happens)
- **Unknown to learner** - Cannot do even with help (yet)

AI complicates this because it can "scaffold" you past the ZPD entirely—producing outputs you couldn't evaluate, let alone produce. This feels productive but may bypass the learning that would expand your "known" zone.
