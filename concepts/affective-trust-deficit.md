# Affective Trust Deficit

## What It Is

While cognitive trust (rational assessment of AI competence) can match human levels, affective trust (emotional connection and warmth) is systematically lower for AI than for human collaborators.

## Why It Matters

Teams, relationships, and culture depend on affective trust—the emotional bonds that go beyond rational assessment. If AI-mediated work reduces these bonds, organizations may become more transactional and less cohesive over time.

## Key Insight

From research on human-AI teams:
- **Cognitive trust**: No significant difference between AI and human teammates
- **Affective trust**: Lower for AI teammates
- **Trust behaviors**: Unchanged (people act similarly despite feeling different)

People can rationally accept AI while not emotionally connecting with it.

## Why Affective Trust Is Hard with AI

- **No observable intent**: AI actions don't reveal underlying motivation
- **Limited adaptability**: AI doesn't adapt like humans in social contexts
- **No shared experiences**: Trust in humans builds through shared history
- **Missing reciprocity**: AI cannot reciprocate trust in meaningful ways

## Organizational Implication

If AI mediates team communication:
- Cognitive function preserved (information transfers)
- Affective function diminished (bonds don't form)
- Culture may erode even as productivity increases
