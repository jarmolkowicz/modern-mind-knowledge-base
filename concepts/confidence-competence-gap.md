# Confidence-Competence Gap

## What It Is

AI creates a "skill illusion"—people feel competent when they're not. The gap between confidence and actual capability widens with AI use because correct outputs get attributed to personal understanding.

## Why It Matters

This is the hidden erosion mechanism. You don't notice capability degrading because AI keeps producing good outputs. The gap only becomes visible when you try to work without AI—and by then, significant erosion may have occurred.

## Key Insight

The mechanism:
1. AI produces correct outputs
2. User attributes success to own understanding
3. Delayed/absent feedback provides no correction signal
4. Confidence stays high while competence declines
5. Gap widens invisibly until tested

People don't notice skill degradation until they're forced to perform without AI assistance.

## Metacognitive Illusion

Traditional metacognitive tools assume direct engagement with the task. When AI does the work, you think you understand because the output is correct—but you didn't build the understanding that produced it.

## Why Detection Is Hard

- AI outputs look like your outputs
- Success reinforces the illusion
- No natural feedback loop to correct miscalibration
- Testing yourself requires deliberate effort
