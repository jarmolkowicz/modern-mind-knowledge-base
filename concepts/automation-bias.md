# Automation Bias

## What It Is

The tendency to over-trust automated systems and AI relative to your own judgment, leading to uncritical acceptance of machine-generated outputs even when they contain errors.

## Why It Matters

Automation bias directly undermines quality evaluation—the core capacity needed to use AI effectively. If you systematically trust AI over your own judgment, you lose the ability to catch AI errors. And AI errors in areas beyond your competence may never surface.

## Key Insight

Creates a dangerous feedback loop:
1. Trust AI → don't verify → miss errors
2. Missing errors feels like AI was right
3. Trust increases → verify less
4. Capability to verify erodes

Appropriate reliance is learnable but not the default.
