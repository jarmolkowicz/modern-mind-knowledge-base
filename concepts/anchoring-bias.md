# Anchoring Bias

## What It Is

The tendency for initial information to disproportionately influence subsequent thinking. Once an anchor is set, adjustments away from it are typically insufficient.

## Why It Matters

When AI provides the first response, it becomes an anchor that shapes all your subsequent thinking. Even if you "revise" AI output, your revisions orbit the AI's framing rather than originating from your own perspective.

## Key Insight

AI anchoring is particularly insidious because:
- AI responds first (you asked it)
- AI's framing becomes the default structure
- Your "edits" adjust the anchor rather than replace it
- You lose access to the ideas you would have had without the anchor

The Think-First practice exists specifically to counter anchoring—by generating your own thinking before exposure to AI, you create YOUR anchor first.
