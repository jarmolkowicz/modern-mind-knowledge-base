# Professional Identity Threat

## What It Is

Heavy AI use can erode professional identity—the sense of being a creator, craftsperson, or expert. Professionals report feeling like "editors" rather than "creators" when AI does substantial work.

## Why It Matters

Professional identity is tied to psychological well-being, not just capability. Even if output quality is maintained, the loss of authorship and craftsmanship affects motivation, satisfaction, and sense of meaning in work.

## Key Insight

From research:
- Professionals whose work is heavily AI-mediated report lower sense of craftsmanship
- Common sentiment: "I feel like an editor, not a creator"
- Mechanism: Loss of authorship → diminished professional identity
- Attribution ambiguity: Unclear if success is due to self or AI → undermines self-efficacy

## Psychological Impact

- Heavy AI use → "editor not creator" feeling
- Loss of authorship → diminished identity
- Success attribution unclear → weakened self-efficacy
- Reduced sense of ownership over work

## Restorative Effect

Unassisted work may restore sense of authorship:
- "I did this myself" → stronger self-efficacy
- Clear attribution → identity reinforcement
- Trade-off: productivity pressure remains

## Self-Determination Theory Connection

Three psychological needs affected:
- **Autonomy**: AI may reduce sense of choice/control
- **Competence**: AI may make personal skill feel irrelevant
- **Relatedness**: AI-mediated work may feel disconnected
