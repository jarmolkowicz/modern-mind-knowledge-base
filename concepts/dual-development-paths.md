# Dual Development Paths

## What It Is

Professional capability in the AI era requires developing along two distinct paths simultaneously: (1) Core Expertise and (2) AI Literacy. These paths are separate—progress on one doesn't automatically create progress on the other.

## Why It Matters

Many professionals assume that being expert in their domain makes them expert at AI collaboration, or that AI skill compensates for domain gaps. Neither is true. You need both paths, developed deliberately.

## Key Insight

### Path 1: Core Expertise
*Your foundational cognitive capacities + domain knowledge*

**What you develop:**
- The Three Core Capacities (reasoning, originality, learning)
- Deep domain expertise
- Pattern recognition from direct experience
- Tacit knowledge that can't be articulated

**How you develop it:**
- Unassisted work (productive struggle)
- Direct engagement with complex problems
- Building from primary sources, not AI summaries
- Deliberate practice in your domain

### Path 2: AI Literacy
*Skill in working effectively with AI*

**What you develop:**
- Prompting strategies for your domain
- Pattern recognition of AI failure modes
- Evaluation criteria for AI output
- Hybrid reasoning (integrating AI with your judgment)

**How you develop it:**
- Deliberate practice with AI collaboration
- Experimenting with different engagement modes
- Learning what AI does well vs. poorly in your domain
- Building intuition for effective human-AI integration

**Critical insight:** One path doesn't make the other grow. You must develop both deliberately.
