# AI Oscillation Trap

## What It Is

The cognitive friction and performance degradation that occurs from repeatedly switching between AI-assisted and manual work. This is distinct from simple skill atrophy—the switching itself creates harm.

## Why It Matters

The brain optimizes for available tools, outsourcing functions like memory, decision-making, and situational awareness. When users must revert to manual modes, they experience "cognitive discontinuity"—the brain resists the shift.

This creates a paradox: the more you alternate (which should preserve skills), the more friction you experience, which reinforces AI dependency.

## Examples

- Writers using LLMs find independent ideation feels "sluggish, less fluid"
- Drivers accustomed to Full Self-Driving experience slower reflexes during manual driving
- Physicians relying on AI diagnostics struggle with intuitive pattern recognition when support removed

## Mechanism

Three factors compound:
1. **Cognitive Load Redistribution** - Brain outsources functions to regularly-used tools
2. **Automation Complacency** - Overreliance dulls manual capabilities
3. **Psychological Friction** - Moving between modes creates frustration that reinforces dependency

## Implications for Strategic Alternation

The oscillation trap suggests [[strategic-alternation]] needs careful design:
- Longer periods in each mode may be better than frequent switching
- Transition protocols may help (warm-up before manual work)
- Hybrid modes that keep humans engaged throughout

## Key Quote

"The challenge isn't ensuring how far we can push augmentation but how we ensure that stepping back doesn't become a precarious fall."
