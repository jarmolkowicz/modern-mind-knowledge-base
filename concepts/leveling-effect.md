# Leveling Effect

## What It Is

AI raises the floor of performance while potentially lowering the ceiling. Lower-skilled workers show larger improvements; higher-skilled workers benefit less. The variance between workers narrows.

## Why It Matters

If AI compresses the performance distribution, differentiation becomes harder. Professional value may shift from "being good" to "being different"—and AI pulls everyone toward sameness.

## Key Insight

From BCG study:
- Lower-skilled consultants: 43% quality improvement
- Higher-skilled consultants: 17% quality improvement

AI doesn't amplify expertise—it compensates for its absence.

## The Double Edge

**Benefits**:
- Democratizes access to competent output
- Reduces quality variance in teams
- Helps struggling performers meet standards

**Risks**:
- Reduces motivation for skill development ("why improve if AI compensates?")
- Makes expertise harder to demonstrate
- May prevent development of top performers

## Implications for Professional Development

If juniors use AI to produce senior-level work:
- They skip the struggle that builds capability
- The organization gets good output but doesn't develop talent
- Long-term expertise pool may shrink
