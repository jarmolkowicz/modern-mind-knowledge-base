# Three Core Capacities

## What It Is

The three cognitive capabilities that define professional value: (1) How You Think and Decide, (2) Where Your Ideas Come From, (3) How You Improve Over Time. When these erode, so does the quality of everything you produce—even when using AI.

## Why It Matters

These capacities are what make your work valuable. AI can produce output, but it cannot originate from your perspective, apply your judgment, or develop your expertise. Protecting these capacities protects your professional value.

## Key Insight

### Capacity 1: How You Think and Decide
*Focused on genuine reasoning*

- **First Principles Reasoning** - Building arguments from fundamental truths, not pattern-matching
- **Metacognition** - Critically assessing quality of all thinking (yours and AI's)
- **Quality Evaluation** - Knowing what "good" looks like in your domain

### Capacity 2: Where Your Ideas Come From
*Focused on original perspective*

- **Embodiment** - Unique insights from lived, sensory experience
- **Originality** - Generating novel ideas and expressing unique voice
- **Authentic Synthesis** - Connections from YOUR experience, not statistical patterns

### Capacity 3: How You Improve Over Time
*Focused on continuous learning*

- **Learning Through Struggle** - Effortful work that builds deep capabilities
- **Adaptive Expertise** - Expertise that evolves with changing contexts
- **Deliberate Practice** - Structured effort that compounds over time
