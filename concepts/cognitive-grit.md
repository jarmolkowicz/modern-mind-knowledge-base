# Cognitive Grit

## What It Is

Mental endurance—the willingness to remain mentally present when answers arrive slowly, problems resist solution, and discomfort persists. Cognitive grit is thinking stamina.

## Components

- Resistance to premature problem-solving
- Tolerance for ambiguity
- Refusal to disengage from unfinished work
- Patience with confusion before clarity

## Why It Matters

Research shows cognitive ability remains resilient when exercised throughout life. Later-life cognitive distinction depends less on early brilliance than sustained engagement with complex problems.

But AI changes the environment: "When cognitive tools reliably shorten effort, they alter the environment in which thinking develops." Answers now arrive before understanding fully forms.

Without friction forcing engagement, cognitive grit may not develop naturally. It must become intentional.

## Cognitive Durability

Related concept: the long-horizon capacity to sustain depth and judgment across life stages. Historically built through unavoidable friction; now requires deliberate cultivation.

## Key Quote

"Difficulty must sometimes be retained rather than eliminated."

## Implications

The challenge isn't whether human thinking survives but whether we actively maintain environments supporting sustained intellectual engagement. This means:
- Deliberately choosing harder paths sometimes
- Resisting the urge to immediately consult AI
- Valuing the process of working through problems
