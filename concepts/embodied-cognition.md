# Embodied Cognition

## What It Is

The theory that cognition is fundamentally shaped by having a body that interacts with the world. Knowledge isn't abstract information processing—it emerges from lived, sensory experience.

## Why It Matters

AI processes information but has no body, no lived experience, no sensory interaction with the world. This means certain kinds of understanding are fundamentally unavailable to AI and uniquely human.

## Key Insight

Your unique perspective comes from:
- Living in a specific body with specific sensory experiences
- Moving through specific contexts and situations
- Having emotional and physical responses to events
- Building intuition through embodied practice

AI can remix patterns from text, but it cannot:
- Know what it feels like to face a difficult client
- Sense the energy in a room during a presentation
- Have the gut feeling that something is wrong
- Draw on muscle memory and embodied skill

This is why [[three-core-capacities]] includes "Where Your Ideas Come From"—original insight emerges from embodied experience that AI cannot replicate.
