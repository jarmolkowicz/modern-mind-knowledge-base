# Jagged Frontier

## What It Is

AI capabilities cover an uneven set of skills—not a smooth gradient from "can't do" to "can do." The boundary between where AI excels and where it fails is irregular, unpredictable, and task-specific.

## Why It Matters

You can't reliably predict when AI will help or harm your work based on general categories. A task that seems similar to one AI handles well may fall outside its capability. This makes AI collaboration a judgment skill, not just a tool skill.

## Key Insight

From BCG/Harvard study of 758 consultants:
- **Inside frontier**: 12.2% more tasks, 25% faster, 40% higher quality
- **Outside frontier**: 19 percentage points worse performance

The same consultants who excelled with AI inside the frontier struggled to identify when they'd crossed outside it.

## The Metacognitive Challenge

Consultants frequently:
- Over-relied on AI for tasks outside its capability
- Under-utilized AI for tasks within its capability
- Lacked awareness of when they were crossing the boundary

Knowing the frontier is itself a professional skill.

## Two Collaboration Patterns

**Centaurs**: Clear division of labor between human and AI tasks
**Cyborgs**: Continuous interweaving throughout workflow

Both can work—but both require accurate frontier awareness.
