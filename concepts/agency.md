# Agency

## What It Is

The capacity to originate, judge, direct, and take accountability for outcomes. Agency is the source of professional value—it's what makes your contribution meaningful rather than mechanical.

## Why It Matters

As AI matches or exceeds output quality, professional value shifts to agency: the contextual judgment of knowing when your contribution matters, the accountability of standing behind outcomes, and the capacity that enables both.

## Key Insight

Agency has two expressions, both valid:

| Mode | Agency Expression | What It Requires |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Creating** | You originate work from your thinking | Full engagement of core capacities |
| **Curating** | You evaluate, select, verify, refine AI output | Same core capacities applied to judgment |

**The danger:** Slipping from creator to curator without realizing it. Losing the capacity to create while thinking you're still in control.

**The core insight:** Conscious choice about how to engage IS agency. Losing that choice is where erosion starts. Strategic curation (consciously chosen) preserves agency. Unconscious curation erodes it.

**Professional value formula:**
```
Domain Expertise + Agency Capacity + Accountability = Professional Value
```
