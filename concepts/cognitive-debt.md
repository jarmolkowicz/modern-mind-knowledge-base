# Cognitive Debt

## What It Is

The accumulated cost of relying on AI for cognitive work—when offloading thinking makes it harder to build and maintain your own thinking skills over time.

## Why It Matters

Like financial debt, cognitive debt compounds. Each use of AI without engagement weakens the capacity for the next independent effort. The debt is invisible until you try to work without AI.

## Key Insight

MIT neuroscience study using EEG showed:
- **Brain-only writers**: Strongest brain connectivity, highest engagement
- **Search engine users**: Moderate connectivity
- **LLM users**: Weakest connectivity, minimal engagement

LLM users also showed poorer recall of their own essay content and more homogeneous outputs.

## The Debt Mechanism

```
AI use reduces cognitive engagement
    ↓
Reduced engagement weakens skill development
    ↓
Weaker skills increase reliance on AI
    ↓
Increased reliance further weakens skills
```

Eventually: inability to work without AI, inability to judge when AI assistance is appropriate.

## Not All AI Use Is Equal

- **High debt**: Copy AI output directly, minimal engagement
- **Moderate debt**: Use AI to structure, but do own thinking
- **Low debt**: Use AI for critique after independent work

## Professional Implication

If you routinely use AI for research, drafting, and analysis, you may:
- Lose ability to perform these tasks independently
- Struggle to evaluate AI output quality
- Become dependent even when AI is unreliable
