# Cognitive Offloading

## What It Is

Delegating mental work to external tools or AI rather than performing it internally. Reducing cognitive load by relying on external resources to store, process, or generate information.

## Why It Matters

With AI, offloading becomes dramatically more powerful and subtle. You can now offload thinking itself, not just memory or calculation. The question isn't whether to offload, but whether it's adaptive (strategic) or maladaptive (eroding capacity you need).

MIT neuroscience research (2025) provides neural evidence: EEG monitoring showed LLM users had the weakest brain connectivity during writing tasks, while brain-only writers showed strongest engagement. LLM users also showed poorer recall of their own content—they literally learned less from the work they produced.

## Key Insight

Every time you offload:
- You reduce immediate cognitive load (benefit)
- You reduce practice of that skill (cost)
- You may not notice decay because output quality stays high (danger)

The same act of offloading can be adaptive or maladaptive depending on context and intention.

SCAN Framework maps offloading risk by zone:
- **Substitute zone** (no task knowledge) → High offloading risk
- **Aid zone** (partial knowledge) → Medium offloading risk
- **Complement zone** (task expertise) → Low offloading risk

Your knowledge level determines whether offloading is strategic or erosive.
