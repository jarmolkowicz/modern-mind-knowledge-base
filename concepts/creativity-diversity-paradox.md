# Creativity-Diversity Paradox

## What It Is

AI makes individual creative outputs better (higher novelty and usefulness) while making the aggregate body of work less diverse. Each piece improves; the collection homogenizes.

## Why It Matters

Innovation often emerges from diverse approaches, unusual perspectives, and "interesting failures." If AI pulls everyone toward sophisticated average, breakthrough insights may become rarer—even as individual work quality rises.

## Key Insight

From experimental study on short story writing:
- **Individual level**: 8-9% increase in novelty and usefulness ratings
- **Low performers**: Up to 26.6% quality increase
- **Collective level**: AI-enabled stories more similar to each other

Each story got "better" by standard metrics; the collection became more homogeneous.

## The Mechanism

AI provides:
- Sophisticated baseline ideas everyone builds on
- Common structural patterns that organize thinking
- Language that elevates "weaker" outputs

AI removes:
- Unusual approaches that don't fit training patterns
- Novel connections from diverse personal experiences
- "Interesting failures" that spark breakthroughs

## Strategic Problem

**For individuals**: AI assistance appears beneficial
**For fields/industries**: Collective effect may be harmful
**Result**: Tragedy of the commons—rational individual use, harmful collective outcome
