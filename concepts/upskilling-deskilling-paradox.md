# Upskilling-Deskilling Paradox

## What It Is

The same AI tools and practices can lead to both skill development (upskilling) AND skill erosion (deskilling), depending on how they're used and the user's starting knowledge level.

## Why It Matters

This paradox explains why advice about AI use can seem contradictory. "Use AI to learn faster" and "AI is making you less capable" can both be true—for different people, tasks, or usage patterns.

## Key Insight

Direction of skill change depends on task migration over time:

**Upskilling path:** S → A → C
- Tasks that start in Substitute zone (AI does it) migrate to Aid (AI helps you do it) then to Complement (you do it, AI assists)
- Requires deliberate practice, reflection, explain-back exercises

**Deskilling path:** C → A → S
- Tasks you could do independently slip to needing AI assistance, then full delegation
- Occurs when you consistently delegate without maintaining direct practice

The paradox: the same task can move in either direction based on your choices.
