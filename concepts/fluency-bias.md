# Fluency Bias

## What It Is

The tendency to judge information that is easy to process as more true, valuable, and high-quality than it actually is. When something reads smoothly, we unconsciously assume it's correct.

## Why It Matters

AI produces exceptionally fluent output—grammatically perfect, well-structured, confident-sounding. Our brains read this fluency as quality. But AI fluency doesn't correlate with AI accuracy. AI can write beautiful nonsense.

## Key Insight

Fluency-accuracy dissociation: fluent ≠ correct. AI's polished output lowers your natural skepticism. You feel like you're reading good work, which reduces the energy you invest in verification.

## The Processing Fluency Mechanism

Research identifies "processing fluency" as the specific mechanism: AI outputs are grammatically correct, well-formatted, and confident in tone. This smoothness creates ease of reading that signals truth. Users conflate "sounds good" with "is correct"—even sophisticated users struggle to overcome this bias.

## Extended: The Coherence Trap

Nosta (2025) extends fluency bias into epistemological territory with the [[coherence-trap]]: we accept information as true when it flows smoothly and aligns with existing beliefs. LLMs create a feedback loop—"LLM coherence feels like comprehension, and our brains go along for the ride."
