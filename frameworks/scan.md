# SCAN Framework

## Overview

A human-centric decision-making framework for task assignment with Generative AI. SCAN helps users "scan" their knowledge space before each task to decide how to involve AI appropriately.

## Core Model

SCAN extends Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development by adding a third dimension: "Known to GenAI." This creates four sub-zones:

| Zone | Description | Risk Level |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **S (Substitute)** | Unknown to learner + Known to AI. Tempts automation. | High offloading/sycophancy |
| **C (Complement)** | Known to learner + Known to AI. Enables collaboration. | Low offloading/sycophancy |
| **A (Aid)** | Partial knowledge + Known to AI. Supports augmentation. | Medium offloading/sycophancy |
| **N (Non-negotiable)** | Unknown to AI OR requires human judgment. Must stay human-led. | N/A |

## Key Mechanism

Before each task:
1. **Real-time evaluation** - Monitor which zone this task falls into
2. **Reflection** - After completion, assess what was learned vs. delegated
3. **Learning** - Update mental models of own and AI capabilities

## Upskilling Path

Tasks should migrate from S → A → C over time as task-specific knowledge accumulates. Deskilling occurs when tasks slip from C → A due to over-reliance.

## Strengths

- Provides concrete task-level decision criteria
- Grounded in established learning theory (ZPD)
- Addresses both knowledge workers and students
- Links metacognition to AI use decisions

## Limitations

- Requires honest self-assessment of knowledge level
- Zone boundaries can be unclear in practice
- Doesn't address time pressure vs. learning trade-offs

## Connections

- [[strategic-alternation]] - SCAN provides task-level implementation
- [[cognitive-offloading]] - SCAN maps offloading risk by zone
- [[metacognition]] - SCAN operationalizes with three components
- [[zone-of-proximal-development]] - foundational theory
- [[calibration]] - SCAN-based calibration practice
