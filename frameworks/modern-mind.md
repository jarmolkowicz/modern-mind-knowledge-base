# Modern Mind Framework

## Overview

A practical system for preserving critical thinking, judgment, and cognitive capacity while working productively with AI. Addresses the permanent tension between AI efficiency and human capability.

## Author

Paweł Jarmołkowicz, Modern Mind Initiative, 2026

## Core Idea

Your professional value lives in your capacity for agency—the ability to originate, judge, direct, and take accountability for outcomes. AI creates a permanent tension between efficiency and this capacity. Success requires conscious navigation, not avoidance.

## Key Components

- **Three Core Capacities**: How you think/decide, where ideas come from, how you improve over time
- **Strategic Alternation**: Cycling between unassisted and AI-assisted work
- **Calibration**: Matching engagement mode to context (Think-First / Partner / Evaluate)
- **Monitoring**: Green/Yellow/Red signals of capacity health
- **Ten Axioms**: Empirical foundations the framework derives from

## Foundational Axioms

1. Skills you don't practice will fade
2. Ease feels like truth—we save effort when stakes seem low
3. AI output mimics careful thinking, tricking our ease-seeking brain
4. Catching errors requires understanding how work is made
5. Deep learning requires effort that challenges without overwhelming
6. Accountability requires understanding work well enough to judge it
7. Skills fade slowly; AI output masks the decline
8. Tools can scaffold or substitute—depends on use
9. Identity, curiosity, autonomy engage effort over ease
10. Self-assessment requires doing and feedback

## Strengths

- Grounded in first principles with explicit derivation
- Actionable practices, not just theory
- Addresses psychological reality (biases, ease-seeking)
- Flexible calibration rather than rigid rules

## Limitations

- Primarily individual-focused; team dynamics under-developed
- Domain-specific guidance still emerging
- Quantitative measurement not yet specified
