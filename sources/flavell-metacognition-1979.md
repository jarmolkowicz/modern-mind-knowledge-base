# Flavell (1979) - Metacognition and Cognitive Monitoring

## Citation

Flavell, J. H. (1979). Metacognition and cognitive monitoring: A new area of cognitive-developmental inquiry. *American Psychologist*, 34(10), 906-911.

**DOI:** [10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906](https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906)

## Type

Paper (foundational theoretical)

## Key Insight

Introduced metacognition as a formal concept: knowledge and cognition about cognitive phenomena. Includes metacognitive knowledge (what you know about thinking) and metacognitive regulation (monitoring and controlling your thinking).

## Relevance

Foundational for understanding the "master skill" that protects against AI erosion. Metacognition enables recognizing when you understand vs. when you're just accepting, when you're thinking vs. deferring.

## Supports

- [[metacognition]] - foundational definition
- [[calibration]] - metacognitive skill applied
- [[fluency-bias]] - metacognition counters automatic acceptance
