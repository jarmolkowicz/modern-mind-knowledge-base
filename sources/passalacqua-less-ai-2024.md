## Type

Paper (empirical)

## Key Insight

Learners who practiced with less AI assistance developed stronger skills than those with constant AI support. AI assistance during learning can impede the productive struggle necessary for skill development.

## Relevance

Direct evidence for the core Modern Mind thesis: AI assistance during skill building can undermine the learning process. Supports strategic alternation and unassisted practice.

## Supports

- [[desirable-difficulty]] - empirical support
- [[strategic-alternation]] - evidence that alternation works
- [[capacity-erosion]] - mechanism of AI-induced erosion
