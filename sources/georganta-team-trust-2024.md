# Georganta et al. (2024) - Team Trust in Human-AI Teams

## Citation

Georganta, K., Ulfert, A.S., et al. (2024). Would You Trust an AI Team Member? Team Trust in Human-AI Teams. *Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology*.

## Type

Paper (organizational psychology)

## Key Insight

Cognitive trust (rational competence assessment) can match human levels for AI teammates, but affective trust (emotional connection) is systematically lower. People can rationally accept AI while not emotionally connecting with it.

## Key Findings

- Cognitive trust: No significant difference AI vs human
- Affective trust: Lower for AI teammates
- Trust behaviors: Unchanged (people act similarly)
- Barriers: No observable intent, no reciprocity, no shared history

## Relevance

Extends trust findings to team/organizational level. If AI mediates team communication, affective bonds may erode even as cognitive function is preserved.
