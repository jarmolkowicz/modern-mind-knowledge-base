## Type

Book (theoretical)

## Key Insight

Abstract thought is grounded in bodily experience through conceptual metaphor. Our understanding of complex concepts (time, causation, morality) is structured by physical experience.

## Relevance

Reinforces that human cognition is fundamentally different from AI pattern matching. Original insight emerges from embodied metaphorical thinking that AI cannot replicate.

## Supports

- [[metacognition]] - understanding your own embodied thinking
