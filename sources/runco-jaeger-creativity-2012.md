## Citation

Runco, M. A., & Jaeger, G. J. (2012). The standard definition of creativity. *Creativity Research Journal*, 24(1), 92-96.

**DOI:** [10.1080/10400419.2012.650092](https://doi.org/10.1080/10400419.2012.650092)

## Type

Paper (definitional)

## Key Insight

Creativity requires both originality (novelty) AND usefulness (appropriateness). Something merely novel isn't creative; something merely useful isn't creative. True creativity combines both.

## Relevance

Clarifies what AI can and cannot do. AI can produce novel combinations (pattern mixing) but struggles with contextual appropriateness that comes from understanding. Human judgment remains essential for true creativity.

## Supports

- [[strategic-alternation]] - preserving creative capacity
