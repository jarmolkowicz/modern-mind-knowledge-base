# MIT Media Lab (2025) - Cognitive Debt

## Citation

MIT Media Lab. (2025). Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task. MIT Media Lab (preprint).

**URL:** [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/)

## Type

Paper (neuroscience study)

## Key Insight

EEG monitoring showed LLM users had weakest brain connectivity during writing tasks, while brain-only writers showed strongest engagement. LLM users also showed poorer recall of their own content and more homogeneous outputs. First neural evidence for "cognitive debt."

## Key Findings

- Brain-only: Strongest connectivity, highest engagement
- Search engine: Moderate connectivity
- LLM users: Weakest connectivity, minimal engagement
- LLM users: Poorer recall, more similar outputs

## The Mechanism

Cognitive debt accumulates: AI use → reduced engagement → weaker skill development → increased AI reliance → further weakness.

## Relevance

Provides neurological evidence for [[cognitive-offloading]] costs and validates the need for [[strategic-alternation]].

## Supports

- [[cognitive-debt]] - primary source
- [[cognitive-offloading]] - explains mechanism
- [[desirable-difficulty]] - validates importance
