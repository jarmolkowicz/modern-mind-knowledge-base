## Type

Paper (review)

## Key Insight

Humans naturally offload cognitive tasks to external tools and environments. This is adaptive when it frees resources for higher-order thinking, but can be maladaptive when it prevents the development or maintenance of internal capabilities.

## Relevance

Foundational research for understanding how AI changes cognitive work. Establishes that offloading is a natural human behavior that becomes more powerful and subtle with AI.

## Supports

- [[cognitive-offloading]] - foundational evidence
- [[capacity-erosion]] - explains mechanism
