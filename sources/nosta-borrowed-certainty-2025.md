## Type

Article (thought leadership)

## Key Insight

AI hasn't made us less intelligent—it has made "confidence cheaper than understanding." Borrowed certainty is confidence in ideas we didn't develop through struggle. The answers may be accurate, but they feel externally sourced rather than authentically earned.

## Framework: Judgment Calibration

Two axes: Cognitive effort (low to high) × Confidence ownership (borrowed to earned)

Four states:
1. **Earned Understanding** - Effort aligns with ownership; stable confidence
2. **Strained Uncertainty** - Genuine work undermined by AI's fluency
3. **Ignorant Ease** - Low effort, low confidence (appropriately calibrated)
4. **Borrowed Certainty** - Minimal effort producing false confidence

## Calibration Drift

Confidence gradually disconnects from effort and internal understanding. Key signals (hesitation, confusion, revision, doubt) fade as AI intrudes.

## Practical Test

"Before you rely on an AI-generated conclusion, try to explain it without AI's help. If you can't, the confidence is borrowed."

## Relevance

Extends [[fluency-bias]] and [[calibration]] with the "ownership" dimension. Provides diagnostic for detecting erosion.

## Supports

- [[borrowed-certainty]] - defines the concept
- [[calibration]] - adds ownership dimension
- [[fluency-bias]] - extends with confidence mechanism
