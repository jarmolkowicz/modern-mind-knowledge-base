## Type

Paper (field experiment)

## Key Insight

AI capabilities are "jagged"—uneven across tasks. 758 BCG consultants showed 40% quality gains inside AI's capability frontier but 19pp worse performance outside it. Consultants struggled to identify the boundary, suggesting metacognitive skills are essential.

## Key Findings

- Inside frontier: +12.2% tasks, +25% speed, +40% quality
- Outside frontier: -19pp correct solutions
- Leveling effect: Low performers +43%, high performers +17%
- Two patterns: Centaurs (task division) and Cyborgs (integration)

## Relevance

Landmark study establishing that AI collaboration requires judgment about capability boundaries, not just tool proficiency.
