## Type

Paper (HCI research)

## Key Insight

AI systems impose high metacognitive demands—constant monitoring (Is this good?) and control (What should I do?). Most users lack these skills and default to blind trust. Processing fluency (smooth AI output) creates false confidence.

## Key Findings

Three demand areas:
1. Prompting: Understanding AI capabilities
2. Evaluating: Assessing output quality
3. Automation strategy: Knowing when to delegate

Feedback loops are broken: users rarely discover if AI outputs were correct, preventing calibration.

## Relevance

Provides theoretical framework for why [[calibration]] is essential and why using AI well is a skill distinct from tool proficiency.

## Supports

- [[metacognitive-demand]] - primary source
- [[calibration]] - validates importance
- [[fluency-bias]] - explains mechanism
