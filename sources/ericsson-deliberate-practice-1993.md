# Ericsson et al. (1993) - Deliberate Practice

## Citation

Ericsson, K. A., Krampe, R. T., & Tesch-Römer, C. (1993). The role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert performance. *Psychological Review*, 100(3), 363-406.

**DOI:** [10.1037/0033-295X.100.3.363](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.100.3.363)

## Type

Paper (theoretical + empirical)

## Key Insight

Expert performance results from accumulated deliberate practice—structured activities specifically designed to improve performance. Not just any practice, but effortful engagement at the edge of current ability with feedback.

## Relevance

Foundational for understanding why productive struggle matters. AI can eliminate the effortful practice that builds expertise. Expertise requires deliberate difficulty, not ease.

## Supports

- [[desirable-difficulty]] - theoretical basis
- [[strategic-alternation]] - why unassisted work matters
- [[capacity-erosion]] - what's lost without practice
