# Science Advances (2024) - Creativity Diversity Paradox

## Citation

Science Advances. (2024). Generative AI Enhances Individual Creativity but Reduces Collective Diversity. *Science Advances*, doi:10.1126/sciadv.adn5290.

**URL:** [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn5290)

## Type

Paper (experimental study)

## Key Insight

Writers using AI showed 8-9% individual creativity improvements, but their stories were more similar to each other than human-only stories. AI enhances individual quality while homogenizing collective output—a tragedy of the commons.

## Key Findings

- Individual: +8.1% novelty, +9.0% usefulness
- Low performers: Up to +26.6% quality
- Collective: Increased similarity between outputs
- Mechanism: Convergence toward "sophisticated average"

## Relevance

Demonstrates that individual and collective effects of AI can diverge. Rational individual use may produce harmful collective outcomes.
