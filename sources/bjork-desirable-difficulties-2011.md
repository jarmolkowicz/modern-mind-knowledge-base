## Type

Paper (synthesis of experimental research)

## Key Insight

Conditions that make learning more difficult in the short term often produce better long-term retention and transfer. Testing, spacing, interleaving, and generation all create beneficial difficulty.

## Relevance

Provides theoretical foundation for why [[strategic-alternation]] works and why pure AI assistance may undermine learning. The discomfort of working without AI may be exactly what builds cognitive capability.

## Supports

- [[desirable-difficulty]] - foundational evidence
- [[strategic-alternation]] - design rationale
- [[think-first]] - why solo work matters
