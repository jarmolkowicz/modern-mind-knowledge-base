## Type

Book chapter (theoretical)

## Key Insight

Distinguished between routine expertise (efficient but inflexible) and adaptive expertise (flexible, can handle novel situations). Adaptive expertise requires understanding principles, not just procedures.

## Relevance

- [[desirable-difficulty]] - variation builds adaptability
