# Nosta (2025) - Rough Draft

## Citation

Nosta, J. (2025, August). Why AI Shouldn't Replace the Rough Draft. *Psychology Today*.

**URL:** [psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-digital-self/202508/why-ai-shouldnt-replace-the-rough-draft)

## Type

Article (thought leadership, cites research)

## Key Insight

The value of writing lies in the thinking demanded during creation, not in the polished output. When AI generates full drafts instantly, users bypass "the slow, messy, generative phase" where deeper connections form.

## Research Cited

A study in *Consciousness and Cognition* compared hand-writing versus drawing words. Drawing consistently produced better memory retention because it engaged "richer thought patterns"—visual imagery, motor movements, and spatial relationships simultaneously.

## Two Modes

- **Creation mode**: messy, iterative, cognitively rich
- **Selection mode**: scanning AI output, tweaking, approving—cognitively thin

## Key Quote

"Memory and understanding aren't built in the output; they're built in the making."

## Practical Recommendation

Preserve "generative friction" by:
- Sketching outlines before prompting
- Diagramming ideas
- Freewriting rough drafts before AI refinement

## Relevance

Provides specific application of [[desirable-difficulty]] to writing. Supports [[think-first]] practice.

## Supports

- [[think-first]] - why drafting before AI matters
- [[desirable-difficulty]] - applied to creative work
- [[five-stage-workflow]] - rationale for human-first creating stage
