## Type

Book (foundational theoretical)

## Key Insight

Cognition is fundamentally embodied—it emerges from having a body that interacts with the world. Knowledge isn't abstract information processing but arises from lived, sensory experience.

## Relevance

Establishes why AI cannot replace human insight that emerges from embodied experience. Your unique perspective comes from living in a body, in a context—something AI lacks entirely.

## Supports

- [[metacognition]] - embodied self-awareness
- [[strategic-alternation]] - preserving embodied knowledge
