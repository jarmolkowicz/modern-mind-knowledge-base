# Passalacqua et al. (2024) - Partial Automation

## Citation

Passalacqua, M., et al. (2024). Practice With Less AI Makes Perfect: Partially Automated AI During Training Leads to Better Worker Motivation, Engagement, and Skill Acquisition. *International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction*.

## Type

Paper (experimental)

## Key Insight

Large effect size (d = 0.9) showing partial automation preserves skills AND motivation. Full automation led to 23% worse skill acquisition compared to partial automation. Mechanism: maintains autonomy, cognitive engagement, and practice opportunities.

## Key Findings

- Partial automation > full automation for skill development
- Effect size d = 0.9 (large)
- Reduced autonomy → lower motivation → less engagement → skill deficit
- Chain reaction from automation design to capability outcomes

## Relevance

Strongest experimental evidence for [[partial-automation-principle]]. Provides confident design guidance for AI workflows.

## Supports

- [[partial-automation-principle]] - primary source
- [[strategic-alternation]] - validates approach
- [[desirable-difficulty]] - explains mechanism
