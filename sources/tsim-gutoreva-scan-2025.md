## Type

Paper (framework proposal)

## Key Insight

A human-centric framework for deciding when and how to involve AI in tasks, based on Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development and metacognition. Introduces four "sub-zones" (Substitute, Complement, Aid, Non-negotiable) determined by whether knowledge is "known to learner" and "known to GenAI."

## Relevance

Provides operational specificity for task-level decisions that Modern Mind's strategic alternation addresses at a higher level. Offers concrete criteria for when AI use leads to upskilling vs. deskilling.

## Supports

- [[scan]] - source framework
- [[strategic-alternation]] - complements with task-level decisions
- [[cognitive-offloading]] - provides zone-based analysis of offloading
- [[metacognition]] - operationalizes with three components
- [[calibration]] - provides SCAN-based calibration method
