## Type

Article (thought leadership)

## Key Insight

Repeatedly switching between AI-assisted and manual work creates "cognitive discontinuity"—a distinct harm beyond simple skill atrophy. The brain optimizes for available tools, and switching back creates friction that paradoxically reinforces AI dependency.

## Examples

- Writers using LLMs find independent ideation feels "sluggish, less fluid"
- Drivers accustomed to Full Self-Driving experience slower reflexes during manual driving
- Physicians relying on AI diagnostics struggle with intuitive pattern recognition when support removed

## Key Quote

"The challenge isn't ensuring how far we can push augmentation but how we ensure that stepping back doesn't become a precarious fall."

## Relevance

Identifies a unique risk in [[strategic-alternation]]—the switching itself has costs. Connects to [[capacity-erosion]] but describes a distinct mechanism.

## Supports

- [[ai-oscillation-trap]] - defines the concept
- [[strategic-alternation]] - adds nuance about switching costs
- [[capacity-erosion]] - describes oscillation-specific erosion
