## Type

Paper (experimental)

## Key Insight

When people save information externally (to a file), they remember it less well but free cognitive resources for learning new information. Demonstrates trade-off: offloading has benefits (freed capacity) and costs (reduced retention).

## Relevance

Shows cognitive offloading is not simply bad—it can enable learning by freeing resources. The question is whether offloading is strategic (adaptive) or habitual (maladaptive).

## Supports

- [[cognitive-offloading]] - nuanced view of costs/benefits
- [[strategic-alternation]] - when offloading is appropriate
