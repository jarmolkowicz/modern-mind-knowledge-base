## Type

Article (thought leadership, cites research)

## Key Insight

When people stop using AI tools, their performance often drops **below their pre-AI baseline**—not just to where they started. AI's immediate performance boost comes at the cost of degraded underlying capabilities.

## Research Cited

A study in *The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology* found that gastroenterologists using AI to detect polyps improved detection rates while AI was active. But "when those same doctors went back to working without AI, their detection rates dropped below where they'd been before the technology was introduced."

## Mechanism: Out-of-the-Loop Problem

Connected to automation research showing that when systems handle critical tasks, human situational awareness erodes. Users "scan less, anticipate less, and make fewer micro-adjustments"—creating erosion rather than mere skill pausing.

## Proposed Solutions

- Mix AI-on and AI-off practice sessions
- Prioritize human decision-making with AI support
- Conduct regular takeover drills measuring unaided performance
- Track and reward performance without AI

## Relevance

Provides empirical support for [[capacity-erosion]]. The "rebound effect" is distinct from gradual erosion—it's an active degradation below baseline.

## Supports

- [[capacity-erosion]] - empirical evidence of below-baseline drop
- [[strategic-alternation]] - rationale for alternation practices
- [[green-yellow-red-monitoring]] - why monitoring unaided performance matters
