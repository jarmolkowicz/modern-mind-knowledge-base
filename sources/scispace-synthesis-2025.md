# Scispace Literature Synthesis (2025)

## Citation

Scispace Research Synthesis. (2025). Analysis of 831-Paper Literature Review on AI and Cognitive Preservation. December 2025.

## Type

Literature synthesis (831 papers)

## Key Insight

Comprehensive synthesis validating cognitive erosion concerns while identifying key moderators: expertise level (novices most vulnerable), automation level (full > partial for erosion), task type (procedural > creative), and use pattern (answer-only > explanation-focused).

## Key Findings

**Strong Evidence**:
- Skill atrophy in procedural tasks with full automation
- Over-reliance and dependency in decision-making
- Metacognitive miscalibration (overconfidence)
- Partial automation preserves skills better (d = 0.9)

**Moderate Evidence**:
- Reduced engagement and motivation
- Professional identity threat

**Weak/No Evidence**:
- Long-term career effects (too early)
- Brain structure changes (no evidence)

## Evidence-Based Recommendations

**Tier 1 (Strong Evidence)**:
- Choose partial over full automation
- Weekly unassisted skill checks
- Calibration exercises
- Explanation practice

**Tier 2 (Moderate Evidence)**:
- Strategic alternation
- Deliberate practice programs
- Career-stage-adjusted AI use

## Relevance

Most comprehensive research synthesis on AI and cognitive preservation. Validates Modern Mind Framework while identifying evidence gaps.
