## Type

Article (thought leadership)

## Key Insight

AI's greatest appeal isn't its intelligence but the relief it offers from accountability. By enabling "consequence-free reasoning," AI removes the psychological weight that historically shaped human thought.

## Anti-Intelligence Defined

Intelligence stripped of the obligations that normally give thinking its meaning. It operates without four essential human conditions:
- No stake in conclusions
- No risk in confidence
- No cost for error
- No need to commit to outcomes

## Key Quotes

- "Thinking, in its human form, is something we live with"
- "Human intelligence was never just about producing answers. It was about being answerable for them"

## Relevance

Reframes AI risk as "relief from responsibility" rather than replacement. Connects to [[accountability]] and [[authorship-levels]].

## Supports

- [[anti-intelligence]] - defines the concept
- [[accountability]] - why consequence matters
- [[capacity-erosion]] - mechanism through abdication
