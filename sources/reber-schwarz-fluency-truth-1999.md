## Citation

## Type

Paper (experimental)

## Key Insight

Demonstrated experimentally that statements presented in easier-to-read formats are judged as more likely to be true. The effect occurs automatically and unconsciously.

## Relevance

Foundational evidence for fluency bias. Explains mechanism by which polished AI output bypasses critical evaluation—it literally feels more true because it's easy to read.

## Supports

- [[fluency-bias]] - experimental evidence
- [[metacognition]] - need awareness to counter automatic effect
