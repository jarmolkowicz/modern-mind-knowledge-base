# Gentner & Markman (1997) - Structure Mapping in Analogy

## Citation

Gentner, D., & Markman, A. B. (1997). Structure mapping in analogy and similarity. *American Psychologist*, 52(1), 45-56.

**DOI:** [10.1037/0003-066X.52.1.45](https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.52.1.45)

## Type

Paper (theoretical)

## Key Insight

Analogical reasoning involves mapping structural relations between domains, not just surface similarity. First principles reasoning builds from fundamental structures; analogical reasoning transfers from known domains.

## Relevance

AI excels at pattern matching (surface similarity) but struggles with deep structural analogy that humans use for genuine insight. Distinguishes human reasoning from AI pattern completion.

## Supports

- [[metacognition]] - recognizing reasoning type
