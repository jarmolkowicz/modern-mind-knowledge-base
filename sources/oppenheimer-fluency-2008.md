## Type

Paper (review)

## Key Insight

Processing fluency—the ease with which information is processed—affects judgments of truth, quality, and confidence. Fluent stimuli feel more true, more familiar, and more trustworthy, independent of actual accuracy.

## Relevance

Explains why AI output feels trustworthy: it's fluent. The fluency-accuracy dissociation is critical—AI produces exceptionally fluent output that may be wrong.

## Supports

- [[fluency-bias]] - foundational evidence
- [[automation-bias]] - fluency compounds trust
