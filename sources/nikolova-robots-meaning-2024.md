## Type

Paper (empirical)

## Key Insight

Automation reduces workers' sense of meaning and self-determination, even when job security is maintained. The psychological impact of automation goes beyond productivity to affect professional identity.

## Relevance

Addresses identity erosion distinct from capability erosion. Work can feel hollow even when output is high—a warning sign in the Modern Mind framework.

## Supports

- [[capacity-erosion]] - identity dimension
- [[strategic-alternation]] - maintaining meaningful engagement
