## Citation

Hohenstein, J., & Jung, M.F. (2020). AI as a Moral Crumple Zone: The Effects of AI-Mediated Communication on Attribution and Trust. *Computers in Human Behavior*, 106.

## Type

Paper (experimental)

## Key Insight

In successful communication, AI mediation increased trust (4.8→5.76). In failures, AI absorbed blame—functioning as a "moral crumple zone" that protects human communicators from accountability.

## Key Findings

- Success: AI invisible, trust increases
- Failure: AI blamed as "coercive agent"
- Asymmetric effect: credit to humans, blame to AI

## Relevance

Shows AI changes accountability dynamics in communication—potentially preventing authentic relationship repair while offering short-term protection.
