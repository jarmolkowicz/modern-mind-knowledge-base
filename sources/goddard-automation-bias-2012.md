## Type

Paper (systematic review)

## Key Insight

Systematic review confirming automation bias occurs across domains. Found that expertise level, workload, and trust calibration affect susceptibility. Importantly, even experts exhibit automation bias under certain conditions.

## Relevance

Provides evidence that automation bias affects everyone, not just novices. Relevant for understanding why even experienced professionals can over-rely on AI.

## Supports

- [[automation-bias]] - systematic evidence
- [[calibration]] - expertise doesn't eliminate bias
