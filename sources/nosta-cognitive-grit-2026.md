# Nosta (2026) - Cognitive Grit

## Citation

Nosta, J. (2026, January). Cognitive Grit in the Age of AI's Easy Answers. *Psychology Today*.

**URL:** [psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-digital-self/202601/cognitive-grit-in-the-age-of-ais-easy-answers)

## Type

Article (thought leadership, cites research)

## Key Insight

Cognitive ability remains resilient when exercised, but AI removes the friction that historically forced deep engagement. "Cognitive grit"—the mental endurance to engage with difficult ideas—must now become intentional rather than automatic.

## Research Cited

A 2023 longitudinal study of intellectually gifted individuals showing that "cognitive ability, when exercised, doesn't atrophy with age." Later-life cognitive distinction depends less on early brilliance than sustained engagement with complex problems.

## Concepts Defined

**Cognitive Grit**: Thinking endurance—the willingness to remain mentally present when answers arrive slowly. Includes:
- Resistance to premature problem-solving
- Tolerance for ambiguity
- Refusal to disengage from unfinished work

**Cognitive Durability**: Long-horizon capacity to sustain depth and judgment across life stages.

## Key Quote

"When cognitive tools reliably shorten effort, they alter the environment in which thinking develops."

## Relevance

Connects [[desirable-difficulty]] to lifelong cognitive maintenance. Provides rationale for intentionally preserving struggle.

## Supports

- [[cognitive-grit]] - defines the concept
- [[desirable-difficulty]] - application to AI context
- [[strategic-alternation]] - why unassisted work matters
