# Bauer et al. (2022) - Discontinuing ML Support

## Citation

## Type

Paper (experimental)

## Key Insight

ML decision aids can latently prevent development of decision-making skills—only apparent when the system is discontinued. The degree of "blind trust" in predictions determines the performance drop when AI is removed.

## Key Findings

- Skill loss only visible after ML aid removal
- Blind trust correlates with larger performance drop
- Prevention of skill development, not just atrophy
- Dependency forms during use, reveals itself after

## Relevance

Experimental evidence for [[cognitive-debt]] accumulation during AI use. Shows the hidden nature of erosion—capability loss is masked until AI is unavailable.

## Supports

- [[cognitive-debt]] - mechanism evidence
- [[confidence-competence-gap]] - blind trust dynamic
- [[capacity-erosion]] - experimental demonstration
