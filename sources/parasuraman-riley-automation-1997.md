# Parasuraman & Riley (1997) - Humans and Automation

## Citation

Parasuraman, R., & Riley, V. (1997). Humans and automation: Use, misuse, disuse, abuse. *Human Factors*, 39(2), 230-253.

**DOI:** [10.1518/001872097778543886](https://doi.org/10.1518/001872097778543886)

## Type

Paper (review)

## Key Insight

Introduced taxonomy of human-automation interaction problems: misuse (over-reliance), disuse (under-reliance), and abuse (inappropriate automation design). Established that automation bias—trusting automated systems over contradictory information—is a fundamental human tendency.

## Relevance

Foundational research for understanding automation bias in AI contexts. The misuse/disuse/abuse framework applies directly to AI tool use.

## Supports

- [[automation-bias]] - foundational evidence
- [[cognitive-offloading]] - explains over-reliance mechanism
