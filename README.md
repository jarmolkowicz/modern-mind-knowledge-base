# Modern Mind — Knowledge Base for the AI Age

Research-backed concepts for preserving human thinking, judgment, and agency while using AI productively.

**Not anti-AI. Not blindly pro-AI. Pro-human.**

## What's Inside

- `concepts/` — Name what's happening to our thinking with AI (cognitive debt, fluency bias, jagged frontier...)
- `frameworks/` — Decision models for when to use AI and when to think independently
- `practices/` — Ready-to-use exercises and rituals (think-first, calibration, strategic alternation...)
- `sources/` — 30+ curated papers with key findings you can plug into decks and curricula

## Who This Is For

**Teachers** — Educators, corporate trainers, L&D professionals, and workshop facilitators who build learning experiences about AI and human thinking.
- Run a 30-min workshop: `concepts/cognitive-debt.md` → `concepts/fluency-bias.md` → `practices/think-first.md` — research-grounded, ready to deliver.
- Give your team an AI decision framework: `practices/calibration.md` is a ready-to-use tool participants take home.

**Researchers** — Academics, AI ethics professionals, policy advisors, and scientists who need structured evidence to build on.
- Ground your writing in evidence: browse `sources/` for 30+ curated papers from cognitive science, HCI, and behavioral economics — each with key findings and full citations.

**Practitioners** — Consultants, strategists, designers, developers, and leaders who use AI daily and want to preserve their thinking, judgment, and expertise.
- Make the business case for responsible AI use: `concepts/jagged-frontier.md` has BCG data on when AI helps and when it hurts. `concepts/novice-vulnerability.md` quantifies the risk for early-career talent.

Every entry is evidence-grounded and ready to use.
