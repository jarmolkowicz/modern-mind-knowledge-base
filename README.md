# Modern Mind — Knowledge Base for the AI Age

Research-backed concepts for preserving human thinking, judgment, and agency while using AI productively.

**Not anti-AI. Not blindly pro-AI. Pro-human.**

## The Problem

AI is advancing fast. Our understanding isn't keeping up.

The risk isn't that AI replaces us. It's that we quietly outsource our thinking without realizing it — and wake up unable to do the work that once defined us.

We don't need more hype. We need wisdom.

## What's Inside

- `concepts/` — Name what's happening to our thinking with AI (cognitive debt, fluency bias, jagged frontier...)
- `frameworks/` — Decision models for when to use AI and when to think independently
- `practices/` — Ready-to-use exercises and rituals (think-first, calibration, strategic alternation...)
- `sources/` — 30+ curated papers with key findings you can plug into decks and curricula

## What Makes This Different

- **Pro-human, not anti-AI** — The question isn't "use AI or not?" — it's how to use it without eroding judgment and skill.
- **Evidence-first** — Every concept and practice ties back to primary research or well-documented field patterns. No opinion pieces.
- **Designed for teaching** — Entries are written so you can drop them into a slide deck, syllabus, or workshop with minimal rework.

## What You Can Do With It

**Run a workshop on AI and critical thinking →** Start with `concepts/cognitive-debt.md` → `concepts/fluency-bias.md` → `practices/think-first.md`. You'll have a 30-minute session grounded in research, not opinion.

**Make the business case for responsible AI use →** `concepts/jagged-frontier.md` has BCG data showing when AI helps and when it hurts. `concepts/novice-vulnerability.md` quantifies the risk for early-career talent.

**Give your team a practical AI decision framework →** `practices/calibration.md` is a ready-to-use tool for deciding when to use AI and when to think independently.

**Ground your writing or research in evidence →** Browse `sources/` for 30+ curated papers from cognitive science, HCI, and behavioral economics — each with key findings and full citations.

Every entry is evidence-grounded and ready to teach from.

## Why Open Source

This field is emerging. It needs diverse perspectives — cognitive scientists, ethicists, practitioners, educators. No single person has the full picture.

I can't do this alone. That's the point.
