# Modern Mind — Knowledge Base for the AI Age

Research-backed concepts for preserving human thinking, judgment, and agency while using AI productively.

**Not anti-AI. Not blindly pro-AI. Pro-human.**

## The Problem

AI is advancing fast. Our understanding isn't keeping up.

The risk isn't that AI replaces us. It's that we quietly outsource our thinking without realizing it — and wake up unable to do the work that once defined us.

We don't need more hype. We need wisdom.

## What's Inside

- `concepts/` — Ideas and phenomena (cognitive debt, fluency bias, jagged frontier...)
- `frameworks/` — Systems and models for human-AI collaboration
- `practices/` — Actionable guidance (think-first, calibration, strategic alternation...)
- `sources/` — Primary research with full citations

## Who It's For

- **Educators** building AI literacy curricula
- **Corporate trainers** designing workshops
- **Researchers** exploring human-AI collaboration
- **Power users** who want to learn directly

Every entry is evidence-grounded and ready to teach from.

## How to Use It

**Building a workshop?** Start with `practices/strategic-alternation.md` and `practices/calibration.md`.

**Worried about over-reliance?** Explore `concepts/cognitive-debt.md` and `practices/think-first.md`.

**Researching this space?** Browse `sources/` for primary literature from cognitive science, HCI, and behavioral economics.

## Why Open Source

This field is emerging. It needs diverse perspectives — cognitive scientists, ethicists, practitioners, educators. No single person has the full picture.

I can't do this alone. That's the point.
