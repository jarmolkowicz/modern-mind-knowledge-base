# Modern Mind — Knowledge Base for the AI Age

Research, practice, and professional insight translated into concepts you can teach from, apply, and verify. An evidence-grounded knowledge base for preserving human thinking, judgment, and agency while using AI productively.

**Not anti-AI. Not blindly pro-AI. Pro-human.**

## What's Inside

- `concepts/` — Name what's happening to our thinking with AI (cognitive debt, fluency bias, jagged frontier...)
- `frameworks/` — Decision models for when to use AI and when to think independently
- `practices/` — Ready-to-use exercises and rituals (think-first, calibration, strategic alternation...)
- `sources/` — 30+ curated papers with key findings you can plug into decks and curricula

Entries synthesize and translate published research. Original authors and papers are cited in each entry and in `sources/`.

## Who This Is For

**Educators** — Corporate trainers, L&D professionals, workshop facilitators, professors, and content creators. You'll find concepts you can teach from directly, practices your participants can take home, and sources to back every claim.

**Practitioners** — Consultants, strategists, designers, developers, leaders, and anyone navigating AI in their professional work. You'll find named phenomena you recognize but couldn't articulate, and frameworks for deciding when to lean on AI and when to think for yourself.

## Getting Started

- New to the topic? Start with `concepts/cognitive-debt.md` — it connects to most other entries.
- Want to teach from it? `practices/` has exercises ready to run. `sources/` has the citations to back them up.

## Contributing

I can't do this alone. That's the point.

If you're a researcher, academic, or scientist — your work is what makes this KB credible. Review entries, challenge interpretations, contribute sources. Every entry has a `reviewed_by` field waiting for you.

Everyone else: add sources, translate ideas to your domain, build on top.

See `_guide/contributing.md` for guidelines.
