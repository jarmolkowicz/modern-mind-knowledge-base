# Modern Mind — Knowledge Base for the AI Age

Curated knowledge on AI and human thinking — structured for your AI to use as context, or for you to use directly.

Research, practice, and professional insight translated into concepts you can teach from, apply, and verify.

**Not anti-AI. Not blindly pro-AI. Pro-human.**

## What's Inside

- `concepts/` — Named phenomena: cognitive debt, fluency bias, jagged frontier, and 35 more
- `frameworks/` — Decision models for when to use AI and when to think independently
- `practices/` — Methods for preserving thinking capacity: think-first, calibration, strategic alternation
- `sources/` — 30+ curated papers with key findings and full citations

Entries synthesize and translate published research. Original authors and papers are cited in each entry and in `sources/`.

The curation process is deliberately semi-automated — AI-assisted, human-reviewed. See `_guide/contributing.md` for how and why.

## Who This Is For

**Educators** — Corporate trainers, L&D professionals, workshop facilitators, professors, and content creators. You'll find concepts you can teach from directly, practices your participants can take home, and sources to back every claim.

**Practitioners** — Consultants, strategists, designers, developers, leaders, and anyone navigating AI in their professional work. You'll find named phenomena you recognize but couldn't articulate, and frameworks for deciding when to lean on AI and when to think for yourself.

## Getting Started

- **Use it with your AI** — Download the [knowledge pack](https://github.com/jarmolkowicz/modern-mind-knowledge-base/releases/latest), a single file with the full KB. Upload it to Claude Projects, NotebookLM, a Custom GPT, or any AI assistant that lets you upload files. Then prompt it to design, write, audit, or teach.
- **Browse it yourself** — Start with `concepts/cognitive-debt.md` — it connects to most other entries. `practices/` has actionable methods. `sources/` has the citations.


## Contributing

This is an emerging field. No single person or framework has the full picture.                                                                                          
The KB gets stronger with diverse perspectives — practitioners, educators, and
researchers who challenge, validate, and build on what's here.

Review entries, challenge interpretations, contribute new sources, translate
ideas to your domain, or build on top. Every entry has a `reviewed_by` field
waiting for a name.

The easiest way to contribute is to [open an issue](https://github.com/jarmolkowicz/modern-mind-knowledge-base/issues) — suggest a source, flag an error, or propose a concept. For writing entries directly, see `_guide/contributing.md`.
