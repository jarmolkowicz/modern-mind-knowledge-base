# Green/Yellow/Red Monitoring

## What To Do

Self-assess weekly using observable behavioral signals. Focus on what you DO, not how you FEEL.

## How To Do It

**Weekly review (10-15 min):**

**🟢 Green signals:**
- Work effectively without AI when needed
- Catch AI errors and improve its output
- Reject or significantly transform AI contributions
- Still learning and developing skills
- Can confidently explain your work

**🟡 Yellow signals:**
- Mild discomfort working without AI
- Accepting most AI output without changes
- Recent heavy AI reliance
- Difficulty explaining work without referencing AI

**🔴 Red signals:**
- Significant difficulty working without AI
- Accepting AI output nearly verbatim (<20% changes)
- Can't distinguish good from plausible-but-wrong
- Work feels hollow despite productivity

**Actions:**
- Green: Keep current approach
- Yellow: Increase unassisted work 20-30%, schedule AI-free day
- Red: 2-4 week restoration, 50%+ unassisted work

## Why It Works

Makes [[capacity-erosion]] visible before it's severe. Yellow is normal—the skill is catching it early.
