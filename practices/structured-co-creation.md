# Structured Co-Creation Mode

## What To Do

You provide a human seed, AI expands a specific aspect, you transform and integrate. Repeat in cycles.

## How To Do It

**The cycle:**

1. **Write human seed** - 1-3 sentences of YOUR thinking (non-negotiable starting point)
2. **Give bounded task** - ONE specific, limited task anchored to your seed
3. **Transform output** - Inject your voice, examples, perspective into AI's expansion
4. **Integrate selectively** - Only keep what fits your thinking
5. **Repeat** - New seed → bounded task → transform → integrate

**Example cycle:**

| Step | Example |
|------|---------|
| Your seed | "The core problem is clients don't trust AI-generated analysis." |
| AI task | "Expand this into a paragraph explaining why trust matters in consulting." |
| Transform | Add your client examples, adjust language to your voice, connect to your argument |
| Integrate | Keep the parts that fit, discard the rest |

**Bounded task examples:**
- "Expand this point into a paragraph"
- "Suggest three examples for this concept"
- "Rewrite this in a more formal tone"
- "What's missing from this argument?"

## Why It Works

You maintain control of direction. AI expands specific aspects, but the architecture and integration are yours. You should be rejecting or significantly transforming 40-60% of what AI provides.

**Warning signs you're doing it wrong:**
- Prompting before writing anything yourself
- Copying AI output verbatim without transformation
- Can't explain your argument without referencing "what AI said"
- Accepting more than 60% of AI output unchanged
