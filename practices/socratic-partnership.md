# Socratic Partnership Mode

## What To Do

Bring YOUR raw thinking to AI. AI challenges and extends. You defend and refine YOUR ideas.

## How To Do It

**Prerequisites:**
- You must have generated your own thinking first (non-negotiable)
- You have a position, thesis, or analysis to defend

**The process:**

1. **Generate first** - Do solo thinking before engaging AI
2. **Bring raw thinking** - Share your unpolished ideas, not a finished draft
3. **Request challenge** - Ask AI to find gaps, challenge assumptions, provide counter-arguments
4. **Defend your position** - Explain WHY you believe what you believe
5. **Refine YOUR ideas** - Update your thinking based on the dialogue
6. **Maintain ownership** - The ideas remain yours; AI helped you sharpen them

**Example prompts:**
- "Here's my analysis: [your thinking]. Challenge my assumptions and find gaps."
- "I believe [your thesis]. What's the strongest counter-argument?"
- "I'm seeing a connection between X and Y. Ask me questions to help me clarify this."
- "Poke holes in this reasoning: [your argument]"

## Why It Works

You stay in the driver seat. AI extends your thinking without replacing it. Your brain remains in active sense-making mode because you're defending and refining, not accepting.

**Critical warning:** If you skip the solo foundation and start here, you're having AI generate ideas for you to react to. That's dependency, not partnership.
