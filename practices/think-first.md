# Think-First Practice

## What To Do

Do substantial solo work BEFORE any AI involvement. Generate your foundation first, then bring AI in to extend or challenge YOUR work.

## How To Do It

1. Close all AI—no ChatGPT, no copilot, nothing
2. Set minimum solo period (15-30 min for typical tasks, longer for complex work)
3. Do the hard thinking yourself: outline, analysis, rough draft
4. Sit with discomfort—this is where your voice emerges
5. Only after substantial solo work: bring AI in to extend, challenge, or polish
6. Transform AI contributions significantly—make them yours

## Why It Works

Your brain does the cognitive work. AI scaffolds and challenges but doesn't replace your thinking. This preserves [[desirable-difficulty]] and prevents [[anchoring-bias]] to AI's initial output.
