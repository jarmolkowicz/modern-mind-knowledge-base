# Continuous Improvement Loop

## What To Do

Cycle through Recognize → Practice → Adjust to continuously refine your AI engagement over time.

## How To Do It

### RECOGNIZE (Read Signals)

Monitor and notice:
- Which contexts need YOU vs. when AI is sufficient
- When your judgment is sharp vs. degrading
- Whether you're maintaining balance (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Patterns in your work and AI use

### PRACTICE (Apply Framework)

Act on what you recognize:
- Ask calibration questions for each task
- Choose appropriate mode consciously
- Maintain capacity through unassisted work
- Apply judgment to AI-assisted work

### ADJUST (Refine Approach)

Learn from experience:
- What worked? (Quality output + capacity maintained)
- What didn't? (Poor quality or judgment degraded)
- Where did you misjudge context?
- How to calibrate better next time?

Then loop back to RECOGNIZE with improved awareness.

## Why It Works

```
RECOGNIZE → PRACTICE → ADJUST
    ↑                      ↓
    └──────────────────────┘
```

Each cycle sharpens your judgment. You get better at:
- Recognizing contexts
- Noticing balance slippage
- Choosing modes
- Developing intuition for when to struggle through vs. when to use AI strategically

This isn't one-time learning—it's ongoing refinement that compounds over time.
