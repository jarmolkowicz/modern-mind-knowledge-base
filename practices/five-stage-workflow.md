# Five-Stage Workflow

## What To Do

Apply Strategic Alternation across five universal stages of knowledge work: Learning, Research, Thinking, Creating, Refining.

## How To Do It

For each stage, use calibration to determine your engagement mode.

### Stage 1: LEARNING (Building Knowledge)

| Requirement | Approach |
|-------------|----------|
| High (core expertise) | Unassisted learning, deep reading, handwritten notes |
| Moderate (adjacent domain) | AI as tutor, Socratic dialogue |
| Low (quick overview) | AI summaries, you evaluate relevance |

**Key principle:** Never substitute AI summaries for deep reading in core expertise areas.

### Stage 2: RESEARCH (Gathering Inputs)

| Requirement | Approach |
|-------------|----------|
| High (novel problem) | Unassisted research, develop your own information-seeking strategy |
| Moderate (established area) | AI helps organize, you direct inquiry |
| Low (routine gathering) | AI collects/synthesizes, you verify quality |

**Key principle:** AI for logistics (finding sources), you for processing (reading, notes, synthesis).

### Stage 3: THINKING (Forming Ideas)

| Requirement | Approach |
|-------------|----------|
| High (strategic, original insight) | Unassisted thinking, your ideas, your responsibility |
| Moderate (building on frameworks) | AI as thought partner, Socratic dialogue |
| Low (routine problem-solving) | AI proposes solutions, you evaluate fit |

**Key principle:** Always start with unassisted ideation before bringing AI in.

### Stage 4: CREATING (Producing Output)

| Requirement | Approach |
|-------------|----------|
| High (original work, your voice) | Unassisted creation, primary authorship |
| Moderate (established patterns) | Structured co-creation: you write seed, AI expands, you transform |
| Low (routine output) | AI generates, you verify |

**Key principle:** For high-stakes or voice-dependent work, draft yourself first.

### Stage 5: REFINING (Improving Work)

| Requirement | Approach |
|-------------|----------|
| High (subtle judgment needed) | Unassisted refining, develop editorial eye |
| Moderate (structural improvements) | AI suggests, you decide |
| Low (grammar, formatting) | AI corrects, you verify critical sections |

**Key principle:** You maintain final decision authority. AI feedback is input, not instruction.

## Why It Works

The five stages are universal cognitive patterns. By applying calibration at each stage, you ensure appropriate human engagement throughout the work, not just at the end.
