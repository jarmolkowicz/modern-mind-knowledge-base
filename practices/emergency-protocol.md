# Emergency Protocol

## What To Do

When you're in Yellow/Red state but must deliver immediately, use AI as needed while committing to restoration afterward.

## How To Do It

**The situation:** "I'm Yellow/Red but I have a deadline in 2 hours"

**Reality:** Sometimes you must deliver immediately despite poor cognitive state.

**Harm reduction approach:**

1. **Acknowledge the compromise** - You're using AI more heavily than ideal
2. **Use AI as needed to deliver** - Get the work done
3. **Schedule restoration immediately** - Block specific time THIS WEEK for unassisted work
4. **Don't let emergency become pattern** - One compromise, not a new habit
5. **After delivery, assess** - "How did I get here?" and adjust workflow

**Post-emergency questions:**
- Was this a genuine emergency or poor planning?
- What would prevent this situation next time?
- When specifically will I do restoration work?

## Why It Works

Harm reduction is better than either:
- Refusing to use AI and missing deadline (capacity destruction through burnout)
- Using AI without acknowledging it (pattern becomes habit)

The key is the commitment to restoration. Without it, emergency becomes excuse.

**The trap to avoid:** Perpetual emergency preventing restoration. If every task is urgent, you're in a system problem, not a task problem. Address the system.
